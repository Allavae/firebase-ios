# Friendly Eats
## An Experiment in Swift and Firebase

This is a simple project, wherein I aim to replicate custom functionality I have implemented previously, with a simple solution based upon Firebase. This including the real-time updates and the notes on objects, which in this case take the form of reviews.

### Current State

* Initial Firestore tutorial ( see below ) was used as a base.
* An "Add Restaurant" View controller was added, so you can add custom Restaurants

### Whats Next

* Adding custom image uploads, so that you can leave it as default if you wish, or upload an image yourself.
* Adding accurate locations using google maps, so you could potentially ask for directions.


### Below is the readme that came with the inital project that this was based upon.

### Friendly Eats

This is the source code that accompanies the
[Firestore iOS Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firestore-ios).

The codelab will walk you through developing a restaurant recommendation app
powered by Cloud Firestore on iOS.

If you don't want to do the codelab and would rather view the completed sample
code, see the [Firebase iOS Quickstart repository](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios)
or the `codelab-complete` branch.
